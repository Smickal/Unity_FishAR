  FishDescription: 'The Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus albacares) is a large and fast-swimming
    fish known for its vibrant yellow fins and streamlined body. It''s highly prized
    both commercially and in sport fishing due to its size, speed, and delicious
    meat.


    Yellowfin tunas have a sleek, streamlined body, with distinct bright
    yellow fins, particularly on their dorsal and tail fins. Their body color is
    typically metallic blue on top and silver on the underside. They also have long
    pectoral fins and a sharp, pointed head.


    Yellowfin tuna can grow to impressive
    sizes, with adults reaching up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length and weighing
    as much as 400 pounds (180 kg). However, most yellowfin tunas caught are much
    smaller, around 50 to 100 pounds (22 to 45 kg).


    Known for their speed,
    yellowfin tuna can swim at speeds of up to 46 miles per hour (74 km/h), making
    them one of the fastest fish in the ocean.'
