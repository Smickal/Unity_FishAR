  FishDescription: 'The Moorish Idol (Zanclus cornutus) is a visually striking fish
    known for its distinctive shape and bright coloration, often associated with
    tropical coral reefs.


    The Moorish idol has a triangular body, long, flowing
    dorsal fin, and a filamentous tail. Its body is decorated with bold black, white,
    and yellow patterns, with a prominent black vertical stripe running across the
    middle of its body. This distinctive look gives it a highly ornamental appearance.


    Moorish
    idols are omnivores, mainly feeding on sponges, algae, and small invertebrates
    that are found on coral reefs. They play an important role in keeping the reef
    ecosystem balanced by grazing on algae and helping maintain reef health.
