  FishDescription: "The Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) is a large, predatory seal
    species found in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. Known for its powerful
    build and distinctive spotted coat, it is a skilled predator in its icy environment.\n\nLeopard
    seals are large, growing up to 10\u201312 feet (3\u20133.5 meters) in length
    and weighing around 440\u20131,320 pounds (200\u2013600 kg).\n\nThey are carnivores,
    feeding on a wide variety of prey, including krill, fish, squid, and penguins.
    They are also known to prey on young seals and even small whales.\nThey are easily
    recognizable due to their dark gray or silver coat with black spots, resembling
    a leopard's pattern, hence the name.\n"
