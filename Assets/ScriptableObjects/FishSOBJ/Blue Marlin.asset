  FishDescription: 'The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) is one of the largest, fastest,
    and most powerful fish in the ocean. Known for its sleek, torpedo-shaped body
    and long, sharp bill, this fish is a highly prized catch for sport fishermen
    worldwide.


    They have a deep blue back, silvery-white belly, and long, pointed
    bill, which they use to slash at schools of fish to stun their prey.


    They
    are among the fastest fish in the ocean, capable of reaching speeds of up to
    50 mph (80 km/h).


    They feed on tuna, mackerel, squid, and other fish, using
    their bill to injure prey before swallowing them whole.
