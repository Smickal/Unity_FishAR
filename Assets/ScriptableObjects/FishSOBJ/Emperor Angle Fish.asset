  FishDescription: "The Emperor Angelfish (Pomacanthus imperator) is a strikingly
    beautiful and vibrant reef fish known for its bold blue, yellow, and black coloration.
    It is commonly found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, particularly around
    coral reefs.\n\n The adult Emperor Angelfish has deep blue and yellow stripes
    across its body, with a dark blue face and yellow \"rays\" extending from the
    center of its body. Juveniles are more blue with yellow and black markings.\n"

  FishClues:
  - As a juvenile, I have blue with yellow and black markings.
  - I can be aggressive and territorial, especially towards other angelfish.
  - I am not an easy fish to keep in captivity and require a large tank.
