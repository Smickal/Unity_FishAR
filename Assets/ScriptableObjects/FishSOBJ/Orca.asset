  FishDescription: 'The Orca, also known as the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca), is a
    large marine mammal known for its intelligence, strength, and striking black-and-white
    coloration. Orcas are apex predators and are highly social animals, often living
    in groups known as pods.


    Orcas are the largest member of the dolphin family,
    with males growing up to 32 feet (9.8 meters) long and weighing as much as 22,000
    pounds (10,000 kg). Females are slightly smaller, growing up to 26 feet (8 meters)
    and weighing around 16,500 pounds (7,500 kg).


    Orcas are carnivores and
    are known for their diverse diet, which can include fish, squid, seals, whales,
    and even sharks. They are highly skilled hunters and often use cooperative hunting
    strategies to catch prey.


    Orcas are incredibly intelligent and have been
    observed using tools, such as beaching themselves to catch prey on land. They
    are also known for their playful behavior, which includes surfing on waves or
    interacting with other marine animals.


    Orcas are highly vocal, using a
    variety of calls and echolocation to communicate with each other, navigate, and
    hunt. Each pod has its own distinct dialect.'
