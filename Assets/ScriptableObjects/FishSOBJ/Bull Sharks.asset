  FishDescription: "The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is one of the most aggressive
    and adaptable sharks, known for its ability to survive in both saltwater and
    freshwater. It is a large, powerful predator commonly found in warm coastal waters,
    rivers, and even lakes.\n\n Bull sharks have a thick, heavy body, a broad, flat
    snout, and small eyes, giving them a distinct, tough appearance.\n\nUnlike most
    sharks, bull sharks can survive in rivers and lakes, thanks to their ability
    to regulate salt levels in their bodies. They have been found in the Amazon River,
    Mississippi River, and even Lake Nicaragua.\n\nBull sharks eat fish, dolphins,
    turtles, birds, and even other sharks!\n\nDue to their presence in shallow waters,
    bull sharks are believed to be one of the most common species involved in shark
    attacks on humans.\n"
