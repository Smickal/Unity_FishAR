  FishDescription: 'The Clown Triggerfish (Balistoides conspicillum) is a boldly
    patterned reef fish known for its striking colors and aggressive personality.
    It is found in tropical coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region.


    It has
    a black body covered in large white spots on the lower half, a yellow snout,
    and a leopard-like pattern on its upper body, making it one of the most recognizable
    fish in the ocean.


    Like all triggerfish, it has a special locking dorsal
    spine that it raises when threatened, making it hard for predators to pull them
    out of hiding spots.
