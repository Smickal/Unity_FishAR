  FishDescription: 'The Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is one of the
    largest and most powerful predatory fish in the ocean, renowned for its strength,
    speed, and aggressive nature.


    Great whites have large, serrated teeth that
    can be over 2 inches (5 cm) long. They are capable of shredding through the flesh
    of seals, dolphins, and other prey.


    They are apex predators, primarily
    feeding on seals, sea lions, fish, and sometimes dolphins or small whales. They
    hunt by using ambush tactics, swimming below their prey and attacking from below
    with great speed and force.
