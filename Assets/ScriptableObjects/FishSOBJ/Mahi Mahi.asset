  FishDescription: 'The Mahi-Mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), also known as dorado or
    golden dolphinfish, is a brightly colored, fast-swimming fish found in warm oceanic
    waters. Known for its distinctive coloration and delicious taste, the mahi-mahi
    is highly prized by both commercial and sport fishermen.


    Mahi-mahi are
    brightly colored, with vibrant blue, green, and yellow hues. They often change
    color as they swim and interact with light. The males, known as bulls, have a
    large, prominent forehead.


    They have a relatively short lifespan, typically
    living up to 5 years, but their rapid growth and reproduction ensure that their
    populations remain stable.
