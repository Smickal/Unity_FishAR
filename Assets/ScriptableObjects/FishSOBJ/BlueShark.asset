  FishDescription: 'The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is a sleek, fast-swimming shark
    known for its vibrant blue coloration and long, slender body. It is found in
    temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, often roaming the open sea.


    Blue
    sharks have elongated, torpedo-shaped bodies with long pectoral fins, allowing
    them to glide effortlessly through the water.


    They mainly eat squid, small
    fish, and crustaceans, but they are opportunistic and will scavenge when food
    is scarce.


    Blue sharks are heavily targeted for their fins, leading to
    population declines in many areas.
