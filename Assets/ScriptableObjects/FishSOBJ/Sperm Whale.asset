  FishDescription: 'The Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest toothed
    whale and one of the most remarkable marine mammals. Known for its distinctive
    square-shaped head and massive size, the sperm whale is an apex predator and
    an incredible deep diver.


    Sperm whales are massive creatures, with males
    growing up to 60 feet (18 meters) in length and weighing as much as 57,000 pounds
    (26,000 kg). Females are smaller, reaching about 40 feet (12 meters) in length
    and weighing up to 15,000 pounds (6,800 kg).


    he sperm whale''s head makes
    up about one-third of its body length. Its head is also filled with a large organ
    called the spermaceti organ, which is thought to help with buoyancy control and
    echolocation.


    Sperm whales were historically hunted for their oil, particularly
    in the 19th century, which significantly impacted their populations. Today, they
    are considered vulnerable due to threats like entanglement in fishing nets, ship
    strikes, and pollution. However, they are protected by international conservation
    laws.


    Sperm whales can live up to 70 years or more, with females typically
    living longer than males.'

  FishClues:
  - I am the largest toothed whale, with males growing up to 60 feet (18 meters)
    long.
  - ' My head is massive, making up about one-third of my body, and contains a large
    organ called the spermaceti organ.'
  - I primarily feed on squid, including the giant squid, and I can dive to depths
    of up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in search of food
  - ' I use echolocation by producing clicks to find my prey in the deep, dark waters.'
  - ' I was heavily hunted for my oil, but I am now considered vulnerable and protected
    under international conservation laws.'
