  FishDescription: "The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a large, herbivorous marine
    turtle known for its distinctive green-colored fat beneath its shell. These turtles
    are found in tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide.\n\nSize \u2013 Green
    turtles can grow up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length and weigh between 240\u2013700
    pounds (110\u2013315 kg).\n\nUnlike other sea turtles, green turtles are primarily
    herbivores, feeding on seagrasses and algae, which contribute to their green-colored
    fat.\n\nGreen turtles can live for up to 80 years in the wild.\n\nDue to threats
    like habitat loss, illegal hunting, bycatch, and climate change, green turtles
    are considered endangered and are protected by international conservation efforts."
