  FishDescription: 'The Stingray is a fascinating marine animal known for its flat,
    disc-shaped body and barbed tail that can deliver a painful sting. They are part
    of the Ray-finned fish family, and they are closely related to sharks.


    Stingrays
    have a flattened, disk-shaped body with wings that resemble a kite. Their bodies
    are often covered in rough, sandpaper-like skin. They have eyes on top of their
    head, and their mouths are located on the underside of their body.


    Stingrays
    are carnivores, feeding on small fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and worms. They
    typically hunt by burrowing in the sand to uncover their prey. Their electroreceptors
    help them locate food by detecting the electrical signals emitted by their prey.


    One
    of the most recognizable features of a stingray is its barbed tail. The barb
    can release a potent venom that causes extreme pain and swelling, but it is usually
    not fatal to humans unless there are complications. Not all stingrays have venomous
    barbs, and many species use their stingers only for defense.

  - I have a flat, disc-shaped body with wings that resemble a kite.
  - My mouth is on the underside of my body, and my eyes are on top of my head.
  - I have a barbed tail, which I use for defense, and my sting can cause pain and
    swelling.
  - I live in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, though some of my species live
    in deeper waters.
  - I am generally slow-moving and peaceful but can become aggressive if provoked.
