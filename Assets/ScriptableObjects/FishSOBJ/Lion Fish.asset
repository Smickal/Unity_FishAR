  FishDescription: 'The Lionfish (Pterois) is a strikingly beautiful yet dangerous
    fish, known for its venomous spines and unique appearance. Native to the Indo-Pacific,
    lionfish have become an invasive species in the Atlantic Ocean.


    Lionfish
    are easily recognizable due to their long, flowing fins that resemble a lion''s
    mane. Their bodies are marked with red, white, and brown vertical stripes, making
    them visually striking.'
