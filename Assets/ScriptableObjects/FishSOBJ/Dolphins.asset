  FishDescription: 'The Dolphin (Delphinidae) is a highly intelligent and social
    marine mammal known for its playful behavior and distinctive bottle-shaped snout.
    Dolphins are found in oceans and seas worldwide, particularly in warm coastal
    waters.


    Dolphins are among the most intelligent animals on the planet,
    capable of using tools, solving problems, and even communicating using complex
    sounds.


    They are known for their playful behavior, such as riding the bow
    waves of boats, leaping out of the water, and playing games with other dolphins
    or even humans.


    Dolphins are highly social animals, living in groups called
    pods, which can range from a few individuals to hundreds.


    Dolphins have
    sleek, streamlined bodies built for speed, capable of swimming up to 25 mph (40
    km/h).'
