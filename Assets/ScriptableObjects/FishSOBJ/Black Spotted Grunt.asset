  FishDescription: 'The Black Spotted Grunt (Pomadasys maculatus) is a species of
    grunt fish found in warm coastal waters, particularly in the western Atlantic
    Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It is known for its distinct black spots, which
    help it blend into its surroundings. It has a silvery-gray body covered in small
    black spots, with a slightly darker back and lighter belly.
