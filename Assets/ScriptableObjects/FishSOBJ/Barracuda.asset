  FishDescription: 'The barracuda (Sphyraena) is a fast, powerful predatory fish
    known for its sleek body, sharp teeth, and lightning-fast strikes. It is found
    in warm, tropical, and subtropical waters around the world.Barracudas can remain
    motionless in the water before exploding forward in an instant to catch prey.



    Barracudas
    are ambush hunters that use their speed (up to 35 mph/56 km/h) and razor-sharp
    teeth to catch fish.They have a long, torpedo-shaped body, a large mouth with
    fang-like teeth, and silvery scales that help them blend in with the water.


    Although
    they rarely attack humans, barracudas are known for their bold and curious nature,
    sometimes following divers.
